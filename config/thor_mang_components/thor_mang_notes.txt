imu is orientated in the same manner as the robot
bdi imu reads z = -9.81 and is orientated upside down

total mass of the robot: 60-65kg or 600-650N
... maybe less as...

Left foot isn't properly calibrated. its force when off the ground is 100N
- could weigh 50kg as a result

60Hz currently
Due to low rate, needed to increae this in leg_estimate.cpp
-  if ( (current_utime_ - previous_utime_)*1E-6 > 30E-3){
+  if ( (current_utime_ - previous_utime_)*1E-6 > 100E-3){


next steps:
- study whats going on with kinematics, doesnt' seem to be behaviour properly
